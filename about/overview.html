  <h2>About This Course</h2>
  <p> Virtual lab is created for understanding the material response (microstructure)when any thermal or mechanical stimuli is provided to it. Also we observe the surface properties via the wetting behaviour of material or extracting the biological response to the surface of biomaterial. In addition ionic conductivity dependence on the composition of material is explained here with. </p>
