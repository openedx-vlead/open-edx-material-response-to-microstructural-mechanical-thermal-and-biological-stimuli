The conductivity (&sigma;), is expressed as the inverse of resistivity (&rho;) i.e., &sigma; = 1/&rho; and its unit is Siemens. Specific conductivity is the reciprocal of the specific resistance of a solution measured between two electrodes 1 cm2 in area and 1 cm apart. Conductivity is measured by placing two electrodes (with opposite electrical charge) in the electrolyte. For a known electrical current, the voltage drop across the electrodes reveals the electrolyte's resistance.</p>
