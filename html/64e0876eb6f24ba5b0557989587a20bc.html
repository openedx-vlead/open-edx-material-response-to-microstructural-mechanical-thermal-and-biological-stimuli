<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; font-size: 18px; font-weight: 200; line-height: 30px; color: inherit;">The contact angle is the angle between solid-liquid interaction at interface or two vapors or two liquids.It is based on the classical liquid-solid-vapor interaction model (Figure 1). The theoretical basis of the contact angle is based on the Young's equation. The contact angle is measured by using an apparatus known as contact angle goniometer.</p>
