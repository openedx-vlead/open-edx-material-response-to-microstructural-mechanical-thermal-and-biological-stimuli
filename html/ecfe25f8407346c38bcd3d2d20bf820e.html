A deformation of this type is considered to be permanent in nature. Sometimes referred to simply as plasticity, this type of deformation can take be conducted under controlled circumstances as well as unintentionally.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; font-size: 18px; font-weight: 200; line-height: 30px; color: inherit;">Both the deformation of plastic and the deformation of metals involve changes to the makeup of the material itself. For example, metals that undergo this process of plastic deformation experience a condition known as dislocation. As stress of some type is exerted on the metal, the material reaches a point known as the yield strength. When this point is achieved, the pattern of the molecules that make up the metal begin to shift. The end result is that the molecules realign in a pattern that is shaped by the exterior stress placed on the object.(Brief and straightforward Guide).</p>
