<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; font-size: 18px; font-weight: 200; line-height: 30px; color: inherit;">Our research group focuses on the fabrication and designing of biomaterials for hard tissue (bone) replacement. The biocompatibility of these biomaterials is tested by performing cell culture studies (adhesion, growth and proliferation) on biomaterial. Examination of the cell morphology is conducted by using fluorescence microscopy technique. Here, in this experiment, imaging of the cytoskeleton of the cells is performed by using a specific dye or a fluorophore which binds to the actin subunits of the cytoskeleton and then fluoresces green under fluorescence microscope.</p>
